# VibeWeb
A platform for streamlined web content generation and design. The project consists of a React-based frontend (webgen) and supporting backend services, designed to help users easily create, edit, and deploy web content

### Drag-and-Drop Interactive Design
VibeWeb features a powerful drag-and-drop editor, allowing users to visually compose their websites by arranging interactive design elements such as text blocks, images, buttons, and layouts. All directly in browser. This no-code approach makes it easy for anyone to create professional-looking pages without technical expertise.

### AI-Powered Code Generation
As users design their pages, VibeWeb leverages AI to automatically translate the visual layout into clean, production-ready code. The generated code is:
- **Beautifully styled:** AI ensures modern, responsive, and visually appealing designs.
- **Tested and run in-browser:** All code is instantly previewed and validated within the browser, so users see exactly how their site will look and function.
- **Exportable:** Users can immediately export their code to their own repositories, enabling seamless integration with existing workflows or deployment pipelines.

This process empowers users to go from idea to live website in minutes, with full control over the final output. By combining a modern frontend with powerful backend automation, users can focus on content creation without worrying about technical details.

Key concepts:
- **No-code/low-code editing:** Build pages visually, with minimal technical knowledge.
- **Automation:** Integrate with APIs to automate publishing, SEO, and analytics.
- **Scalability:** Modular architecture for easy extension and customization.
- **Instant code export:** Take your generated site and deploy anywhere, with no vendor lock-in.
